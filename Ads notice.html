        <h3>Interest-Based Ads notice.</h3><br>
        <p>At Electronic Shop, we use interest-based advertising to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
            We do this by collecting information about your interests, such as the pages you visit on our website, 
            the products you browse, and the purchases you make. 
            We also collect information from third parties, such as social media platforms and advertising networks.</p>
            <p>We use this information to create a profile of your interests, which we then use to show you ads 
                 that are more likely to be of interest to you. For example, if you have been browsing laptops on 
                 our website, you may see ads for laptops from other retailers.
            </p>
            <p>You can choose to opt out of interest-based advertising at any time. 
                 To do this, please visit your ad preferences page.
